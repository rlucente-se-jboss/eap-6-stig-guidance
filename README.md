Overview
========
This guide represents my attempt to further flesh out and expand
upon the security configuration guidance in the approved Defense
Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation
Guidelines for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6
hereafter referred to simply as the
[STIG](http://iasecontent.disa.mil/stigs/zip/U_JBOSS_EAP_6-3_STIG_V1R1_STIG.zip)
with its [release
memo](http://iasecontent.disa.mil/stigs/pdf/u_JBoss_EAP_6-3_stig_release_memo.pdf).
Those links are to the official released documents by DISA and they
should be the normative standard.  All of the content in this
repository will be shared with DISA for possible inclusion in future
releases of the STIG.
